![Sheet](images/unit_12-for_and_since.png)

## Concepts:

> We use `for` and `since` to say **how long** something has been happening.
> 
> `for` + _period of time_.
>
> We often leave out `for` but not usually in negative sentence. You can use `in` instead of `for` in _negative sentences_. We don't use `for` + `all`.
>
> `since` + _the start of the period_.
