# Unit 7: Present perfect 1 - `I have done`.

![Sheet](images/unit_7-present_perfect.png)

## Concepts

> `subject` + `have/has` + `past participle`.
>
> `PP` often ends in **-ed**, but many verbs are irregular.
> 
> When we say something **has happened**, this is usually new information.
> 
> When we use the present perfect, there is a connection with  _now_. **The action in the past has a result now**.
> 
> We can use `just`, `already` and `yet`. `Just` means _a short time ago_. `Already` means _sooner than expected_. `Yet` means _until now_ and we also use it with QW and negative sentences.
