![Sheet](images/unit_4-present_continuous_and_present_simple_2.png)

## Concepts
> _Present continuous_ is used for `actions` and `happenings` that have started but not finished.
>
> The following verbs **aren't** used in _present continuous_: `like`, `want`, `need`, `prefer`, `know`, `realise`, `understand`, `recognise`, `believe`, `suppose`, `remember`, `mean`, `belong`, `fit`, `contain`, `consist` and `seem`.
>
> When `think` means `believe` or `have an opinion`, we **don't** use the _present continuous_. If `think` means `consider` then we use _present continuous_.
>
> We use _present simple_ with: `see`, `hear`, `smell` and `taste`. We can use _present simple_ or _present continuous_ with `look` and `feel`.
>
> We use `am/are/is` `being` to say how a person is **behaving** now. That means the person is doing something they can control.
