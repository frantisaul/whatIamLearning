## Concepts

> When we talk about _a period of time_ that continues from the past until now, we use the **present perfect**.
> 
> We can use `recently`, `in the last few days`, `so far`, `since I arrived`, etc. **past ---> now**.
> 
> We can use `today`, `this evening`, `this year`, etc. when these periods are not finished at the time of speaking. **past ---> now --->**.
